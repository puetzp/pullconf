	  As far as configuration management systems go, Pullconf's features are and will remain to be quite minimal and straightforward.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You might want to consider using it when:
	  <ul>
	    <li>you operate a fleet of homogeneous server systems and your needs for extensive customization are thus low.</li>
	    <li>you are just getting started with system configuration management and other, more powerful systems such as Ansible, Puppet or Chef may be overkill.</li>
	    <li>all the resource types that you require are covered by Pullconf.</li>
	    <li>you do not care so much about DRY ("don't repeat yourself") and value having your client configuration in a comparatively flat structure, instead of having a multi-layered hierarchy and complex rules of inheritance.</li>
	    <li>you can live without a DSL (domain-specific language) that would enable you to conditionally include or exclude resources or resource parameters.</li>
	    <li>you want to turn your pet systems to cattle (to some extent), because it just happens that this is what configuration management systems are for.</li>
	  </ul>
