	<p>
	  Dependencies between resources can be <em>implicit</em> or <em>explicit</em>.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><em>implicit</em> dependencies between resources are established by <em>pullconfd</em> according to certain internal rules. For instance, a <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/directory.html">directory</a> resource depends implicitly on other directory resources if they happen to be a parent node to this directory within the filesystem. There is a section in each resource documentation page that describes the kind of implicit dependency relationships this resource establishes with other resources. Implicit dependencies are established without specific configuration by the user.</li>
	  <li><em>explicit</em> dependencies go beyond implicit dependencies in cases where implicit dependencies do not suffice. They are configured via the <code>requires</code> meta-parameter in each resource (see also <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources.html">Resources</a>).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Explicit dependencies are validated with additional care to avoid dependency loops. Explicit dependencies may also produce other errors during validation if a dependency between two resources cannot be established in a logical sense. For example a <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/directory.html">directory</a> resource at <code>/my/example</code> cannot depend on another directory resource at <code>/my/example/further/down</code>, because the former <u>must</u> be processed before the latter.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To define a dependency using the <code>requires</code> parameter, use the <em>primary parameter</em> of the respective resource as well as their <code>type</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Not every resource has a primary parameter (e.g. <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/resolv.conf.html">resolv.conf</a>), because some resources can only appear once within the entire resource catalog of a client. However most resources are primarily identified by some parameter, e.g. <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/directory.html">directory</a> is primarily identified by their <code>path</code> parameter.
