	  <em>Pullconf</em> is a configuration management system for Debian GNU/Linux and other Debian-based Linux servers. It is heavily influenced by <a href="https://puppet.com" target="_blank">Puppet</a> (a very popular and widely-used configuration management system). In contrast to other configuration management systems this project focuses heavily on simplicity and ease of use. Or to put it in other words: its primary goal is being <em>boring</em>. Ideally as boring as its name.
	</p>
	<p>Pullconf works like this: Clients (i.e. Linux servers running the <em>pullconf</em> binary) communicate with a central server (<em>pullconfd</em>) in order to retrieve a catalog of <em>resources</em> via an HTTP API. These resources are then applied on the client to achieve a desired state, e.g. create a <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/file.html">file</a> at a certain location.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As the name already implies, Pullconf employs a <em>pull-based</em> approach to system configuration: a client actively fetches its resource catalog and applies it according to a schedule (e.g. every 5 minutes).
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>Resources</em> such as <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/file.html">file</a>, <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/directory.html">directory</a> or <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/user.html">user</a> are defined on the <em>pullconfd</em> server, in files following the <a href="https://toml.io" target="_blank">TOML</a> format.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Scripting and the development of custom modules is <u>not</u> supported and out of scope of this project. It focuses instead on including all kinds of resources directly into the project source. It should ultimately be possible to create simple <a href="/v0.1.x/configuration/resources/file.html">files</a> but also operate a Prometheus server by defining them as resources.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This is a basic example for a client configuration file to get a sense of the way TOML is used to define resources:
